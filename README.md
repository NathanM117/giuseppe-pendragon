***WORK IN PROGRESS***

# guiseppe-pendragon

  **Rudimentary design for a health app!** This app is supposed to do all kinds
of cool things, like calculate your daily requirements for things like calories and water,
and macronutrients, and peanuts! With that informaion, you can record what you ate and did as your day
progresses, and then maybe this app will yell at you a he end of the week? We're working on it.


## Project Focus
* Develop backend for an app in Java!
* Learn a little about app development.
* Group Collaboration!!!

food.kcal = 14;
food.carb = 4;
.....

}
```
