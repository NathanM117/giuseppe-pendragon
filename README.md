***WORK IN PROGRESS***

# guiseppe-pendragon

 **Rudimentary design for a health app!** This app is supposed to do all kinds
of cool things, like calculate your daily requirements for things like calories and water,
and macronutrients, and peanuts! With that information, you can record what you ate and did as your day
progresses, and then maybe this app will yell at you at the end of the week? We're working on it.


## Project Focus
* Develop backend for an app in Java!
* Learn a little about app development!
* Execute object oriented principles!
* Group Collaboration!!!

## Project Funcionality
* Create and load multiple user profiles based on user input.
* Store data on food consumed by user as well as nutritional value.
* Make end-of-week suggestions to user based on user profile.

## To Do...
* Research health things
* Think of how to store items...

Ex.
```
// rough pseudo code...
class Food {
// per serving

food.name = "blue-berry muffin";
food.kcal = 142;
food.carbs = 14;
.....

}
```

## Next...
* Break down high level approach
* Draft psuedo-code
